# Decentralized Identity

## Project Description

The Decentralized Identity project is a blockchain-based solution that enables users to create, manage, and verify their digital identities in a self-sovereign manner. Built on Ethereum using Solidity, this smart contract system allows individuals to maintain complete control over their personal data while providing a secure and transparent way to prove their identity to various services and organizations.

The system eliminates the need for centralized identity providers by storing identity information on the blockchain, ensuring that users own and control their data. It supports dynamic attributes, verification workflows, and provides a foundation for building trust in decentralized applications.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to create a world where individuals have complete ownership and control over their digital identities. We aim to:

- **Empower Users**: Give individuals full control over their personal data and identity information
- **Eliminate Intermediaries**: Remove the dependency on centralized identity providers
- **Enhance Privacy**: Ensure that personal information is only shared when explicitly authorized
- **Build Trust**: Create a transparent and verifiable system for identity verification
- **Enable Interoperability**: Provide a standardized way for different applications to interact with user identities
- **Promote Inclusion**: Make digital identity accessible to everyone, regardless of their geographic location or traditional identity documents

## Key Features

### üîê **Self-Sovereign Identity Management**
- Create and manage your own digital identity without relying on centralized authorities
- Complete ownership and control over personal data
- Immutable record of identity creation and updates on the blockchain

### üë§ **Comprehensive Identity Profiles**
- Store basic information (name, email) and IPFS hash for extended profile data
- Add custom attributes like education, skills, certifications, and employment history
- Dynamic attribute system that can be extended as needed

### ‚úÖ **Decentralized Verification System**
- Request verification from authorized verifiers
- Transparent verification process with on-chain records
- Support for document-based verification using IPFS for secure storage

### üîç **Privacy-Preserving Design**
- Users control what information to share and with whom
- Selective disclosure of attributes
- Integration with IPFS for secure off-chain data storage

### üìä **Transparent Governance**
- Owner-controlled verifier authorization system
- Clear audit trail of all identity operations
- Event-driven architecture for easy monitoring and integration

### üí´ **Developer-Friendly Integration**
- Comprehensive view functions for easy data retrieval
- Well-documented smart contract with detailed comments
- Event emissions for real-time monitoring and integration

## Future Scope

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- Hardhat or Truffle for smart contract development
- MetaMask or similar Web3 wallet
- Access to Ethereum testnet (Sepolia, Goerli) or local blockchain

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/decentralized-identity.git

# Navigate to project directory
cd decentralized-identity

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Compile smart contracts
npx hardhat compile

# Deploy to local network
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

### Usage
1. Deploy the smart contract to your preferred network
2. Authorize verifiers using the `authorizeVerifier` function
3. Users can create identities using `createIdentity`
4. Add custom attributes with `addAttribute`
5. Request verification through `requestVerification`
6. Verifiers can process requests using `processVerification`
